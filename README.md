# Welcome to InfoSec N00bs!

I honestly don't know how much traction or updates this place will get. The idea for the project came about during the entire Coronavirus pandemic. During that time I was extremely ill (NOT with the disease-of-the-day...we think) and the medication that I was on made it hard for me to concentrate.

Whenever I have difficulty arranging my thoughts, I have a tendency to force myself into collating data. This sometimes jumpstarts my mind, and lets me get things back on track. In this case, I was looking at all of the questions that I have been seeing from people new to the InfoSec community, and put together a small document that might actually be able to help a little bit.

## Contributions and Process

As of right now, I am the only contributor to this project. Still, I would love to hear from people! This .pdf was created through LibreOffice Draw, using an ebook (magazine) template from the LibreOffice website. The pictures were replaced with pictures from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com) that are free for public/commercial use with or without attribution, and the content was dreamed up pretty much from my own head.

That said, if someone wants to contribute to the project, make your own document, whatever, feel free to create one and make a pull request! I just ask that it be kept in the same naming format, for basic neatness purposes. Credit will obviously be given for anyone who submits information, be it a complete document or just a suggestion on where to go from here.
